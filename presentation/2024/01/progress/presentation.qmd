# Pathway maps

## Current status


## Questions

###  General

- Tipping points represent time and condition, right?
- How crucial is being able to order branches?
- Are these figures published as is?


---

### Pathway map data model

- See NL delta pathway map:
    - transition time?
    - Splitting actions: multiple tipping points? branch points?

---

### Pathway map style
- There are multiple styles of pathway maps. Which one to focus on first?
- Proposal:
    - Settle on a style (classic)
    - Replicate increasingly more complicated examples of pathway maps
- What is the start point of the first action? Currently: tipping point range - 10%
- How to separate overlapping nodes and edges (see IPCC example)? Required?


# Project and planning

- Definition of done
- Let's list priorities

# Your turn

- From now on, releases will contain a command you can use to generate pathway maps
- Please generate your favorite ones and provide feedback
