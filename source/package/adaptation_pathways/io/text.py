"""
This sub-package contains the code for reading and writing to text formatted datasets

A note about handling sequences and tipping points in software and in flat tables:
Each sequences relate a from-action to a to-action. Tipping points relate a to-action to a
tipping point. The first sequence (in time) is special. It represents the current situation:
from a long long time ago to now. This sequence is not part of the collection of tipping points,
because the action representing the current situation is not a to-action but a from-action:
given the current situation, some other action will be implemented. For I/O purposes we use
an extra sequence, representing this "root sequence". This allows us to keep the output as a
simple table with::

    |from-action | to-action | tipping point|

records. For the special case of the "root action" in the "root sequence", the from-action
and to-action are the same.
