Import text files to dataset

Usage:
    {command} <basename> <dataset>

Arguments:
    basename           Name, without postfix and extension of group of files
                       to import from
    dataset            Pathname of dataset to import to. If the dataset
                       already exists, it will be overwritten.

Options:
    -h --help          Show this screen and exit
    --version          Show version and exit

Example:
    {command} serial serial.apw

This example imports information from the following files:
- serial-action.txt → Contains information about each action (required)
- serial-sequence.txt → Contains the sequences that make up pathways
  (required)
- serial-tipping_point.txt → Contains tipping points for each action edition
  (optional)

Information about how information in these file should be formatted can be
found in the documentation.
