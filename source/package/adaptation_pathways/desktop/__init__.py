"""
This sub-package contains code implementing the Pathway Generator GUI application.

.. note::

   The pathway generator is a proof of concept application. It proofs that the pathway plots
   can be made part of an easy to install desktop application, made with Python. It is not
   finished and not fool-proof yet. There are many things not working correctly or still missing.

   #. To proof that a desktop application can be built, using Python bindings to the Qt library,
      that allows the user to create, edit, load, save, plot adaptation pathways.
   #. To that this desktop application can be packaged for and distributed to end-users,
      who don't have to know about Python.

   Most code in this sub-package is on its way to becoming good code. Most of it isn't yet.
   For the desktop application to become a stable, usable application, more work needs to be done.
