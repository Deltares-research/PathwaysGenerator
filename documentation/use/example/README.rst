Examples
========

This section contains examples for plotting pathway maps using the ``adaptation_pathways``
package. The same plots can be created by storing the information about the actions and sequences
in a text- or binary-formatted dataset and using the ``ap_plot_pathway_map`` and ``ap_plot_bars`` commands.
